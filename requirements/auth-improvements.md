# Authentication Improvements

## Overview

We've made several improvements to the authentication system to ensure proper mapping between Clerk (authentication provider) and Supabase (database). This addresses the issues with the like functionality and other authenticated features.

## Key Changes

1. **Added `clerk_id` Column to Users Table**
   - Created a SQL migration to add a `clerk_id` column to the Supabase `users` table
   - Added a UNIQUE constraint to ensure each Clerk ID maps to only one Supabase user
   - Created an index on the column for faster lookups
   - Updated existing users with their corresponding Clerk IDs

2. **Created a Centralized User ID Mapping Function**
   - Implemented `getSupabaseUserIdFromClerk` in `lib/supabase-server.ts`
   - This function follows a consistent process for all API endpoints:
     1. First tries to find a user by `clerk_id`
     2. If not found, tries to find by email and updates with `clerk_id`
     3. If still not found, creates a new user with proper mapping
     4. Includes robust error handling and fallbacks

3. **Updated API Endpoints**
   - Modified all API endpoints to use the centralized mapping function:
     - `/api/favorites`
     - `/api/favorites/check`
     - `/api/generate`
   - Ensured consistent error handling across all endpoints

4. **Improved Client-Side Components**
   - Updated the `FusionCard` component to better handle authentication
   - Enhanced error logging for easier debugging
   - Added special handling for temporary fusions

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Identification**: Users are now consistently identified across both authentication systems
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and logging for authentication issues
3. **Simplified Code**: Centralized user mapping logic reduces duplication and potential inconsistencies
4. **Better User Experience**: Features like liking fusions now work reliably

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all authenticated features to ensure they work correctly
2. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on logs for any authentication-related errors
3. **User Migration**: Consider a script to update any existing users who might still have mismatched IDs
