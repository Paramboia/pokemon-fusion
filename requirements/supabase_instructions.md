To run the stored procedure in Supabase, go to the SQL Editor in the Supabase dashboard and execute the following SQL:
```sql
-- Create a function to increment the likes count for a fusion
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_fusion_likes(fusion_id UUID) RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE fusions SET likes = likes + 1 WHERE id = fusion_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Note: Make sure to run this SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor to create the stored procedure for incrementing likes.
